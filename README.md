## Problem Statement
**Objective:** Develop a web application that allows users to upload an image, resize it based on user-specified dimensions, and view both the original and resized images. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for image upload, resizing, and downloading the resized image.

**Background:** Image resizing is a common task in various applications, such as preparing images for web use, optimizing images for mobile devices, or adjusting dimensions for specific design requirements. An intuitive web application can streamline this process by allowing users to interactively upload, resize, and manage their images.

### Scope:

**Image Upload:** Users should be able to upload an image file (JPEG or PNG) through a web form.
**Image Resizing:** Users should specify new dimensions (width and height) for the image. The application will resize the image using high-quality algorithms.
**Display Images:** The web application should display both the original and resized images.
**Image Download:** Users should be able to download the resized image.

#### Requirements
**Software Requirements**

1. Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. This application is compatible with Python 3.7 and above.
22. Flask: A web framework for Python. Install it using pip.
3. Pillow: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for handling images. Install it using pip.
4. Base64: Built-in Python module for encoding and decoding base64 data.
